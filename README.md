# Crypto-Rush

Now with more than 10,000 crypto assets worth around $2.21 trillion, there’s a plethora of data
that can help guide crypto supporters with various forms of insights and analysis. This data is a
powerful resource for investors who are looking for a deeper understanding of the
cryptocurrency market and want to analyze specific events. Our application, Crypto-Rush, aims

exchanges down to NFTs with real-time and historical prices for major cryptocurrencies, news,

Crypto-Rush is designed to be the premier platform for accessing live as well as historical
market data to see the market fluctuations, news, and social media integration to provide the
latest trends in the market and graphs with historical data to better assess judgments. We
provide a customizable dashboard and a portfolio tracker to get personalized updates and track
different cryptocurrencies and NFTs to the user as well. Crypto-Rush eliminates the customer’s
hassle of visiting and tracking different platforms for information as we can aggregate all data
and provide a one-stop-shop to gain insights on trading crypto assets. With deep insight into
current and past pricing, volume, and exchange info, the user can make the right decisions to
stay ahead of the game
